    "We begin with an important remark. In the non-Markovian setup, we consider a non-recombining structure—that is, two paths that reach the same value at a future time step but have different pasts are treated as distinct. This contrasts with the Markovian case, where only the previous time step is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, when the time horizon increases, the number of distinct paths grows exponentially, making the problem intractable due to the massive sampling required."

    "- **Non-Markovian Case:**\n",
    "  - Provide insights on how to choose an appropriate grid size — not too large to avoid excessive computation, but not too small to preserve accuracy.\n",
    "  - In the README (not in the code), explain that other solvers are either too slow to provide meaningful results or too inaccurate (e.g., neural network-based methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markovian Case:**\n",
    "  - Demonstrate that for a \"non-expanding\" process (e.g., mean-reverting Gaussian or autoregressive), the time complexity scales linearly with the time horizon, and the precision is only slightly affected.\n",
    "  - Show computations for cases where no closed-form solution is available (e.g., Black-Scholes or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) models)."
